        // Hoisting is a behaviour in java script where the declaration of variable and functions are moving to the top.
        // a) Hoisting in the context of a function:
        //   Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning you can call the function before it is defined in the code.
        
        // b) Hoisting in the context of a variable:
        //   Variable declarations (using `var`) are also hoisted, but only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. 
        //  If you use a variable before it's initialized, it will be `undefined`.
      

        // Coded Example of Hoisting:

        // Example a) Function Hoisting
        hoistedFunction(); // This works because the function declaration is hoisted

        function hoistedFunction() {
            console.log("This function was called before it was declared!");
        }

        // Example b) Variable Hoisting
        console.log(hoistedVar); // This logs 'undefined' because the variable is hoisted but not initialized

        var hoistedVar = "This is a hoisted variable";

        // Variable declaration is hoisted, but the initialization ("This is a hoisted variable") happens at the point it is defined.
        console.log(hoistedVar); // This logs the initialized value: "This is a hoisted variable"

        
        //How ECMA Standards Resolved Hoisting:

        //With the introduction of `let` and `const` in ES6, hoisting behavior changed for variables. 
       // Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized until the code execution reaches their declaration.
       // This results in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ), meaning you cannot access these variables before their declaration in the code.
        
        //Example of `let` and `const` resolving hoisting issues:

       // console.log(letVar); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'letVar' before initialization
        //let letVar = "This is a let variable";

        //console.log(constVar); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'constVar' before initialization
        //const constVar = "This is a const variable";

       // In the case of functions, the behavior remains the same for function declarations. However, function expressions (assigned to variables) are not hoisted in the same way. 
       // If you try to call a function expression before its declaration, you'll get an error.
        
       // Example:

        //hoistedFuncExpression(); // TypeError: hoistedFuncExpression is not a function
        // var hoistedFuncExpression = function() {
        //    console.log("This is a function expression.");
        //  };
